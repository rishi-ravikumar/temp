The python scripts form a compiler that converts a simple high-level language (whose syntax was defined by me) to the assembly code for a 16-bit RISC processor called STUMP. I wrote the STUMP processor from scratch using verilog and implemented it on an FPGA board. This compiler allows users to write simple, high-level code which can the be compiled down to STUMP Assembly. A sample high-level code has been given in gm.ri.
